# covid_19
We all are familiar with the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease a.k.a COVID-19 across the world and, the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it as a pandemic, the conditions are getting worse. So I came up with an idea to track it's outbreak in India.


**WHAT IS IT'S PURPOSE?**

The following code extracts the outbreak data (spread) statistics of COVID-19 across India, from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare | Government of India (GOI). This code displays the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed in various states and union territories of India, number of cases leading to death casualties and total patients cured/discharged from the disease/hospital. While wrappind up, it presents a comparison between the source of COVID-19 spreading across India i.e., whether it is spreading due to localites or due to the foreign people here.

**HOW IT WORKS?**

To extract the data from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare | Government of India (GOI), it makes use of the popular data science library for python i.e., Pandas library. And uses python's popular plotting library i.e, Matplotlib to create the visualizations and draw conclusions from them.


**Stay home, stay safe!**
